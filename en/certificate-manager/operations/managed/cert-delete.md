- {{ TF }}

   If you do not have {{ TF }} yet, [install it and configure the {{ yandex-cloud }} provider](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   For more information about {{ TF }}, [see the documentation](../../../tutorials/infrastructure-management/terraform-quickstart.md#install-terraform).

   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the certificate description:

      {% cut "Sample certificate description" %}

      ```hcl
      ...
      resource "yandex_cm_certificate" "le-certificate" {
        name        = "managed-certificate-for-dns"
        description = "this is a certificate for tls"
        domains     = ["my-domain.ru"]

        managed {
        challenge_type = "DNS_CNAME"
        }
      }
      ...
      ```

      {% endcut %}

   1. Apply the changes:

      {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../../_tutorials/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

   You can check if the certificate has been deleted either from the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or using this [CLI](../../../cli/quickstart.md) command:

   ```bash
   yc certificate-manager certificate list
   ```

- API

   To delete a certificate, use the [delete](../../api-ref/Certificate/delete.md) REST API method for the [Certificate](../../api-ref/Certificate/) resource or the [CertificateService/Delete](../../api-ref/grpc/certificate_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call.
