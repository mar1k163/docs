# Set up a service plan

{{ yandex-cloud }} provides technical support under different service plans. You can choose the plan that's best for you. The cost of paid technical support plans includes two components: fixed and supplemental. The fixed portion only depends on the selected plan, while the supplemental portion is calculated as a fraction of the cost of the resources used over the month. For more information about plans, see the [Pricing policy](../../support/pricing.md).
