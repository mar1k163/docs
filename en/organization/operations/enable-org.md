# Creating an organization

[_Organization_](../../overview/roles-and-resources.md) is a workspace that combines different types of {{yandex-cloud}} resources and users. To enable your employees to use {{yandex-cloud}} resources, create an organization and add them to it. Any Yandex user can create an organization in {{org-full-name}}.

To create an organization, follow these steps:

1. [Log in]({{link-passport}}) to your Yandex account. If you do not have an account, [create]({{ support-passport-create }}) one.

1. Go to [{{org-full-name}}]({{link-org-main}}).

1. Read the {{yandex-cloud}} terms of use and click **Log in**.

1. Enter your company name and description.

1. Click **Create organization**.

After registering, you become the organization owner and can manage its settings.

To get started:

- [Add](add-account.md) users with a Yandex account to the organization.
- [Configure an identity federation](../concepts/add-federation.md), so that your employees can log in to the organization using their work accounts.
