# Leaving an organization

If you are not a federated user, you can leave an organization on your own. To do this:

1. Go to [{{org-full-name}}]({{link-org-main}}).

1. If you belong to multiple organizations, click the user profile image in the bottom left corner and select the appropriate organization.

1. In the left-hand panel, select [Users]({{link-org-users}}) ![icon-users](../../_assets/organization/icon-users.svg).

1. In the employee row, click ![icon-context-menu](../../_assets/horizontal-ellipsis.svg) and select **Remove from organization**.

Please note: You will lose access to all clouds and other resources of the organization.

To disable access to the clouds of the organization you are not going to leave, contact the respective cloud's administrator.
