To get notifications, the user must:

* Have the `monitoring.viewer` role for the folder the alert is set up in.
* Specify their email address and phone number, and enable **{{ ui-key.yacloud_components.settings.label_monitoring-name }}** in the management console [settings]({{ link-console-main }}/settings).
