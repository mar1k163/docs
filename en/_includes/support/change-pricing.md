1. On the {{ yandex-cloud }} support center [home page]({{ link-console-support }}), in the left-hand panel, select **Service plans**.

If an organization with an activated support service plan has resources that are paid from different billing accounts, the percentage portion of the plan cost will be paid by each billing account depending on the cost of consumed resources. The fixed portion is paid by one account only: the one specified when selecting the **Business** plan. When you change the plan, you can choose a billing account for debiting the fixed portion of the plan. This option is only available to the organization owner. To change your billing account:

1. In the **Pricing** window, click **Change** to select a different account.
1. In the **Billing account** window, specify a different account using one of the following methods:
   * Select an account from the list.
   * Create a new account.

Service plan upgrades are activated immediately, while downgrades are applied on the first day of the following month. For information on current service plans and examples of how to calculate costs, see [Pricing policy](../../support/pricing.md).
