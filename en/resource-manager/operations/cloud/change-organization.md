# Changing an organization for a cloud

If there are multiple organizations registered in your account, you can move clouds between them.

{% note info %}

Manually [add](../../../organization/operations/add-account.md) to the target organization all users having the roles assigned for the cloud to transfer, folders, or resources in the source organization. The roles are transferred to the new organization automatically.

{% endnote %}


To move a cloud to another organization, you must have the `{{ roles-organization-owner }}` role for the organization and `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` for the cloud. For information on assigning roles to users, see [Roles for cloud](set-access-bindings.md#access-to-user) and [Roles for organization](../../../organization/security/index.md#add-role).

{% list tabs %}

- Management console

  1. In the upper-right corner, click ![***](../../../_assets/options.svg)and select **Change organization**.
