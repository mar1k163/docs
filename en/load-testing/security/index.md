# Access management in {{ load-testing-name }}

{{ load-testing-name }} uses [roles](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) to manage access rights.

In this section, you will learn:
* [Which resources you can assign roles to](#resources).
* [Which roles exist in the service](#roles-list).
* [Which roles are required](#required-roles) for particular actions.

### Service roles {#service-roles}

* `loadtesting.viewer`: Allows viewing reports and created agents.
* `loadtesting.editor`: Allows viewing and deleting reports, creating, deleting, and editing VMs with agents, enables running and stopping load tests, and uploading test data and output to the repository.
* `loadtesting.admin`: At the moment, the service does not include an administrative function, so the role has the same permissions as `loadtesting.editor`.
* `loadtesting.loadTester`: Allows viewing and deleting reports, creating, deleting, and editing VMs with agents, enables running and stopping load tests, and loading test data.
* `loadtesting.generatorClient`: Allows starting VMs, running tests on agents, and uploading the output to the repository (assigned to a service account that is used to create VMs with agents).
